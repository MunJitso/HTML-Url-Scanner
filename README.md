# HTML-Url-Scanner

Ok to be honest, my dad asked me to make him a software that filters working url from his favorite list in Chrome, so yeah i made that program and to have some ConTiBuTes, i published on github, so yeah you can also try it. i dont care my hard work is stolen but though it still have some issues like big lists.. or sites that popes up domain purchasing.
